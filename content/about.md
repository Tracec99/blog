I am an Honors student currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Data Science at the University of Arkansas at Fayettville. I acquired a love for backpacking and the outdoors during my time in the Boy Scouts. I enjoy learning about practically any topic that catches my interest, and I try to never stop learning.
