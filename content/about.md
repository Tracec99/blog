I am a freshman honors student currently majoring in data science at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. My interests include statistics, social data analytics, and environmental research. I have always loved the process of exploring data and discovering new insights. As a data science student at the University of Arkansas I am learning to ask questions with interesting answers and how to use the tools and skills at my disposal to develop data-driven solutions to real-world issues. In the Boy Scouts, I developed leadership, communication, and teamwork skills and acquired a love of the outdoors, earning the Eagle Scout Award in August of 2017.
